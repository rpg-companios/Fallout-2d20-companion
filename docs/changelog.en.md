# Changelog

## 48 — Securitron origin

- The Securitron origin is now fully implemented: the "Mark I Securitron" trait (immunity to poison and radiation, 150 lbs carry weight not affected by Strength or perks, no chems/food/drink/rest benefits, repairs only).
- Own body plan `securitron`: head / body / left arm / right arm / wheel, 1-3-1 layout, hit location table 1-2 / 3-11 / 12-14 / 15-17 / 18-20.
- New robot parts: head, body (150 lbs), manipulator arm with built-in unarmed attack, wheel — stats modeled after the Protectron, ru/en translations included.
- `securitron_standard` equipment kit: automatic laser gun (laser gun with automatic barrel, integrated into the left arm, 14 + 7 CD fusion cell shots), submachine gun (integrated into the right arm, 8 + 4 CD rounds of .45 ammunition), missile launcher and grenade launcher (inoperable until the Mk II OS — inert inventory items flagged `requiresMkII`), factory armor for the torso/head/arms, printer (new robot item, equipped by default, cannot be unequipped).
- The RU prefix of mod `mod_053` now follows the EN convention ("Automatic") so the built-in weapon displays as "Automatic Laser Gun".
- Robot logic now supports the `wheel` slot (limb installation, armor distribution, armor picker, slot labels) and shows a limb's built-in weapon alongside the weapon held in that hand.
- Palm weapons (automatic laser gun and submachine gun) are now integrated into the arm slots (left/right) with applied mods, cannot be unequipped; attack cards show the source arm.
- The kit grenade launcher is the M79 Grenade Launcher.
- New robot item "Mk II OS Driver" (unique, only applicable to a Securitron): an "Apply" button in the inventory consumes the driver and activates the inoperable weapons. Until installed, the missile launcher and grenade launcher appear in the attack list as disabled cards labelled "Requires Mk II OS" (and in the inventory).
- The Mk II OS flag lives in the robot store slice and survives save/load.
- Securitron palms are free: the built-in weapons (laser gun in the left arm, submachine gun in the right) now sit INSIDE the limbs (limb built-in weapons), while the manipulator palms can hold any other weapon or items — regular weapons equip into a hand via the inventory, and the attack card shows the source arm.
- Attack order on the equipment screen: unarmed/melee first (all origins), then built-in weapons, then inoperable Mk II weapons, then weapons equipped from the inventory.
- Securitron head and wheel cells are now 1/3 width (like a cell in a row of three), centered in the row.
- Weapons equipped from the inventory go into the first FREE hand (the second weapon goes to the other hand) instead of always the first by position.
- Robot weapons now live in the store slots (single source of truth): built-in weapons (manipulator, laser gun, SMG) and weapons held in the palms (equipped from the inventory) are stored in the robot slot state instead of the React context. Screens read attacks from the slots — this fixes the bug where built-in weapons disappeared from the attack list after saving/reloading a character (only Mk II weapons remained).
- Fixed an inventory screen crash: isRobot was used in a useMemo before its declaration (TDZ "Cannot access 'isRobot' before initialization"). Added render smoke tests for InventoryScreen/WeaponsAndArmorScreen — this class of errors is now caught by tests.
- The "Mk II OS installed" flag is now stored in the character snapshot and restored on load (previously Mk II weapons became inoperable again after reload).

- Added a "Move to character list" drop zone when viewing a folder.
- Fixed moving a character from a folder back to the root list when dropped over the back zone.
- The "Character folders" setting is persisted between launches.
- When the setting is disabled, the "Create folder" button is fully hidden and characters use the freed grid space.
- Existing folders and character assignments are preserved when the setting is disabled.
- Added Russian and English localization for the folder interface.

---

## 45 — Save migration on application updates

- Added a unified versioned migration system for character saves.
- Save-format changes are represented as sequential migrations between schema versions.
- Migrations run both when loading a character from SQLite and when rehydrating state from AsyncStorage.
- Added a single source of truth for the current schema version and documentation for adding future migrations.
- Legacy saves no longer require manual conversion after an application update.

## 44 — Grip and stock conflict

- Weapon grips and stocks are now mutually exclusive modifications.
- Installing a grip automatically removes the stock, and installing a stock removes the grip.
- The Russian name of the slot was corrected from «Приклад» to «Ложе».

---

## 42 — Legacy-save correction

- Fixed legacy saves in which a weapon could contain mutually exclusive qualities at the same time.
- After loading a save, only one quality from each conflicting pair remains.

---

## 41 — Mutually exclusive weapon qualities

- Fixed the application of mutually exclusive weapon qualities.
- Accurate replaces Inaccurate, and vice versa.
- Reliable replaces Unreliable, and vice versa.

---

## 40 — Tagged-skill rewards

- Fixed duplicate rewards for tagged skills.
- Saving the same tagged skills again no longer adds the rewards a second time.
- If a character receives a new tagged skill later, only that new skill receives its reward.
